    "text": "👋 Hello there! I’m a physicist passionate about AI and the universe. My journey has spanned from healthcare and biotechnology to cosmic explorations, using AI as my compass. I have a special love for emergence and how it weaves complex and fascinating patterns from simple things.\nI’ll be gradually building this blog to document my learnings, aiming to make them as simple and accessible as possible. This is my way of returning the favor to countless blog posts, papers, and code repositories that have helped me. A fervent lover of open source, I believe in shared knowledge. So, let’s embark on this journey of collective learning!"
